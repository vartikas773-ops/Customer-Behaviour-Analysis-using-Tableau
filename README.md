Customer Behavior Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer behavior using demographic and shopping preference data.  
Built in Tableau, the dashboard highlights how gender, age, income, and product choices influence monthly visits and spending patterns. It combines multiple visualizations to provide a clear, interactive view of consumer trends.

Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- Age – Customer age group  
- Annual Income – Reported annual income  
- Monthly Visits – Number of visits per month  
- Gender – Male/Female  
- Preferred Product – Clothing, Electronics, Groceries, Home, Sports  

Dashboard Visualizations  
1. Gender Distribution (Pie Chart + KPI Bar)  
   - Shows total monthly visits split by gender.  
   - KPI bar highlights visit counts (Female: 1,460, Male: 1,873).  

2. Preferred Products by Age Group (Stacked Bar Chart)  
   - Breaks down product preferences across Adults, Middle Aged, Seniors, and Young Adults.  
   - Gender segmentation adds another layer of comparison.  

3. Preferred Product vs Monthly Visits (Bar Chart)  
   - Displays average monthly visits for each product category.  
   - Segmented by gender for deeper insights.  

4. Annual Income vs Monthly Visits (Scatter Plot)  
   - Plots the relationship between income levels and shopping frequency.  
   - Data points are colored by gender and labeled by product category.
